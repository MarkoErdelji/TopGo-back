# TopGo-backend
Our REST API forms the core of our system, built using Java's Spring Boot framework. As we dived into development, we encountered Dependency Injection, a powerful concept facilitated by Spring's Aspect-oriented programming and Annotations. This framework supports key functions for three user roles: Admin, Driver, and Passenger. We have used JWT for authentication and authorization, ensuring a secure user experience.

At the foundation, we employ Spring's JPQL, giving us tools to create custom queries and methods for specific data needs. Our backend seamlessly interacts with the database, ensuring data accuracy and smooth interactions.

A standout feature is the real-time connection between passengers and drivers during shared journeys, made possible through web sockets. This feature enables instant and immersive communication, enhancing the sense of engagement between passengers and drivers.

In summary, our backend framework reflects modern development practices, where Spring, JPQL, and web sockets combine to create a compelling user experience.
